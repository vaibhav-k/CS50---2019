        <center>I am a person of many interests. My interests range from space to computers to wildlife. I also read books a lot.<br><br><br>
        On the TV, my favourite channels are The Discovery Channel and National Geographic. I also like to watch their videos online.<br>
        Space related things also interest me very much. It is a lot of fun to watch documentries related to the Apollo program on TV. I like to read about them also.<br>
        Talking aobut reading, I also read books and enjoy doing so. There is no one favourite genre of mine and so I always have some books to read. I start anything I find fancy or fascinating.<br>
        I am also fasccinated by computers. I found them interesting from when I was a child. I am trying to pursue a career in data science or machine learning. My previous internsip in Japan was also based on a combination of Biology and Machine Learning.<br>
        I also enjoy visiting new places. During my internship in Japan, I travelled nearly the entire country.<br>
        It is a dream of mine to travel the whole world.<br><br><br>
