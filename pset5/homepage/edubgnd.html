        <center>This page will tell wou about my educational background a little.<br><br><br>
        I was always a studios child. I did my schooling in one of the best schools of my city and was able to secure good marks.<br>
        My parents were always proud of me and I was also motivated to do well. This changed when I joined college. I joined a pretty good college but it was far from my hometown.<br>
        Due to this fact my CGPA after my first year was not as high as I was expecting it to be and so I was alotted Electrical and Electronics Engineering intead of Computer Science.<br>
        This was a very difficult time for me as I now had to figure out a way to pursue CSE informally.<br>
        Thankfully, I was able to do it and that's why, last year I went for my internship to Japan in Asia's top ranked university.<br>
        Anyway, I continued to study Machine Learning on my own after that and now I will go to Toronto, Canada for 7 months to write my thesis next year.<br>
        I also gave the GRE exam wen this year started and I was able to secure good marks.<br><br><br>
