        <center>Hello again vistor, this page describes my personality in short. (You will have to get to know me in real life to better appreciate me.)<br><br><br>
        I am a kind, polite and well-mannered boy, 21 years of age. I am not very confident, but have surely increased in confidence over the last few years. I'm also very friendly and have accumulated a lot of good friends in my (nearly) 22 years of existence.<br>
        This point was recently proved when I had an accident which injured my head very seriously and I was in a coma for 3 weeks. This accident has subtly changed my personality but it is mostly due to the medicines I still have to take twice everyday.<br>
        I am hardworking also. Proof for this lies in the fact that although I'm still recovering, I still study roughly around 5 hours everyday. I am also humble.<br><br><br>
